Blimbingsari Airport (Indonesian: Bandara Blimbingsari) (IATA: BWX, ICAO: WADY (formerly WARB)) is an airport near Banyuwangi, a city in the East Java province of Indonesia. The airport was opened for operations in December 2010. Originally the runway was only 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in length and could only accommodate small propeller-driven aircraft such as the Cessna 208, but in 2012 it was extended to 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) to allow large turboprop airliners such as the Fokker 50 and ATR 72 to operate from the airport. In 2011 it served only 7,826 passengers, and in 2015 served more than 110,000 passengers. It is planned to extend the runway to 2,200 metres (7,200 ft) to allow jetliners such as the Airbus A320, Boeing 737 and Bombardier CRJ to operate flights directly from the capital Jakarta. The expansion plan also calls for a new 3,500 square metres (38,000 sq ft) passenger terminal building and a larger apron. In 2015, the runway extension has begun and the pavement will be enhanced to Pavement Classification Number (PCN) 21 from previously PCN 16. The airport resides at an elevation of 33.5 m (110 ft) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 08/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 1,800 m (5,906 ft) in length. Garuda Indonesia (operate by Explore) and Wings Air offer schedule commercial flight to Surabaya from this Airport.
