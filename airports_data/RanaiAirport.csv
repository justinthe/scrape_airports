The airport is also a Type B airbase of the Indonesian Air Force. Other than that, the airport also serves civilian flights.

Additional facilities, such as aircraft hangars, ILS, refueling hangar are also currently being added. More military personnel are also stationed. The government is planning to lengthen the airport's runway from 2.560 m to 3.000 m to accommodate large military aircraft.
