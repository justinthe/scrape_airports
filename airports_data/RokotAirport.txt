Rokot Airport (IATA: RKI, ICAO: WIBR) is an airport in Sipora, West Sumatra. Currently, only small body aircraft can land at the airport. The airport was completed in 1980 with a runway size of 900 x 23 m. However, the airport is now threatened by possible submersion. Erosion near the shoreline, a mere 25 meters away, means that only 800 meters of runway are still usable. In addition to this, stone from the eroded runway is being carried away by surrounding communities for the construction of houses. The operation of the Airport is managed by UPT Ditjen Hubud, an agency under Ministry of Transportation, Indonesia.
