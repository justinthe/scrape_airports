Hang Nadim International Airport (IATA: BTH, ICAO: WIDD), also known as Bandar Udara Internasional Hang Nadim, is located in Batam, Riau Islands, Indonesia. The Airport located 22 km North East from the city. It has been the primary method of transport to and from Batam, alongside ferries to neighboring islands (including Singapore). As Batam continues to develop its tourism sectors, the Hang Nadim has proved a sufficiently effective airport. Originally developed as an alternative airport for Singapore Changi Airport in mind should in case an emergency for aircraft force a redirect. However Changi was developed to grow, and the Sijori Growth Triangle region has 4 airports, including Sultan Ismail International Airport (SENAI Airport) in Johor Bahru and the Seletar Airport. Hang Nadim has facilities and the longest runway (4,000 m) in Indonesia, sufficient for wide body aircraft Boeing 747s. Hang Nadim International Airport became the eighth airport in Indonesia to operate 24 hours a day. The move was the result of many airlines making the airport a hub for their operations.
