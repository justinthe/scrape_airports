Ahmad Yani International Airport (Indonesian: Bandar Udara Internasional Achmad Yani) (IATA: SRG, ICAO: WAHS, previously WARS, previously WIIS) serves Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia. It used to be a military airbase owned by the TNI (Armed Forces of Indonesia) until 1966 when the airport was declared open for domestic commercial flights, other than as an airbase for the Indonesian Army. The airport is in the coastal area of Maron beach in West Semarang district, which is prone to flooding and abrasion. There are ponds around the compound, and mangroves will be planted along the coastline in line with the green airport concept which was scheduled to be completed by June 2013. The area is commonly known as Kalibanteng, hence it was commonly known as Kalibanteng Airbase in the past. The name Achmad Yani was taken to honour one of Indonesia's national heroes, General Achmad Yani. The Airport is operated by PT. Angkasa Pura I, a state enterprise of the Indonesian Ministry of Transport that manages airports in the eastern part of the country. It became an international airport with the first flight of Garuda Indonesia to Singapore in August 2004.
